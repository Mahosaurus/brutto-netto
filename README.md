# brutto-netto

The purpose of this project is to give a more comprehensive overview on earnings, such as the marginal raise in net income after a pay raise.

It uses the information provided on the results of https://brutto-netto-rechner.info/.

There is no API, hence the whole thing might break.

## Setup
python3 setup.py install

python3 -m venv brutto

. brutto/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt


cd service

python3 app.py
